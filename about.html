<h2>Passionate About Inspiring Others</h2>
<p>
    In 2010 I decided to do what I really felt like doing and moved to Florence, Italy. I think I can easily say it’s been the best decision I’ve ever made since it has allowed me to discover who I really am. Away from my habits, my routines, my comfort zone – away from it all to live my very own renaissance. I’ve discovered parts of myself I didn’t know I had and I’ve done things I never dreamt of doing. My next dream was living my true purpose and setting up my life coaching practice in which I help young, ambitious people who are experiencing a lack of fulfillment in their lives to overcome fear, so that they can finally follow their dreams & lead the fulfilling lives they're looking for. I want to help you discover what it is you really want deep inside and to make those long-nurtured dreams come true. If I can do it, you can do it too! Please, get in touch so we can start defining your goals and making your dream life happen!

    <h2>Background and Training</h2>
<p>
 I started out as a secondary school English teacher in The Netherlands. It was great first, but then I started feeling unchallenged, bored and pretty unhappy. I decided to follow my dream: move to Florence to teach English to Italians. When I felt ready for another challenge, I entered the blogging world and discovered the joy of writing. I missed working with people though and this provided me with the - now looking back - immensely valuable moment to consider what I really, really wanted to do in life: work with, help and inspire people. I followed a course to become an ACT-professional in Holland and then proceeded my studies in Rome. I studied with Giovanna Giuffredi of Life Coach Italy and got my International Coach Federation certificate. I'm an ACTP Life Coach and I combine coaching, with ACT and mindfulness in order to help my clients find their values, live their dreams and discover their mission in life. I've found mine, let's find yours!
